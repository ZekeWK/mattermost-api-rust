## Mattermost API rust
This is a WIP which is, and will remain, incomplete.

A rust API-binding for the mattermost API including both HTTP and websocket support. It is based around separate structs for each call, response and event.

TODO:
- Add documentation
- Proper testing
- Receive session token through username and password
- Add support for more calls and events
- Add a ratelimiter
- Add convenience methods
- Better coverage of errors
